Double-clicking the app with no files opens this: a small local web server plus
the default browser. A browser is used rather than Tk because it looks the same

Files are chosen through the NATIVE picker, not an upload, so real paths are
kept: output lands next to the original exactly as it does when files are
dropped on the icon, and a 20MB model never has to move.
