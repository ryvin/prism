"""Prism: retarget any 3mf project for 24 printers across
Creality / Snapmaker / Bambu Lab / Prusa / Elegoo / Voron / Qidi / Sovol /
Anycubic / Flashforge, with model-aware quality/speed planning.

Usage:
  python3 optimise3mf.py --list
  python3 optimise3mf.py --printer <key> [--report] [--mode speed|balanced|quality]
                         [--single [#RRGGBB]] [--spectrum] [--dome off|H]
                         [--no-analyse] [--out PATH] file.3mf [more.3mf ...]
  python3 optimise3mf.py --interactive file.3mf [...]   (console prompts)

The tool analyses each model's geometry first (bed fit, overhangs vs the
support setting, rounded-top "stair ring" risk, large flat tops) and derives
three concrete plans:
  speed     0.28mm layers, dome objects 0.16          (~0.7x balanced time)
  balanced  0.20mm layers, dome objects 0.12          (1x)
  quality   0.16mm layers, dome objects 0.08, ironing on large flat tops
                                                      (~1.3-1.6x)
A source project authored finer than the mode's layer height keeps its finer
value (we never coarsen below the designer's choice except in speed mode).
Geometry is never modified, hash-verified on every run.
